# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Project Description

This project implements an efficient anomaly detection system for continuous data streams using Python 3. The system simulates a real-time data stream with normal and anomalous data points and employs the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies.

## Algorithm Selection

**Isolation Forest** was chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. It works by isolating anomalies instead of profiling normal data points, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suly98/anomaly_detection.git
   cd anomaly_detection_project
