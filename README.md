# Anomaly Detection in Data Streams

## Overview
This project implements a Python script to detect anomalies in continuous data streams using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It simulates a real-time data stream and visualizes detected anomalies.

## Features
- Generates synthetic data streams with normal and anomalous values.
- Implements the Isolation Forest algorithm for effective anomaly detection.
- Visualizes data streams in real-time with highlighted anomalies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
To install the required packages, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the script, execute:

```bash
python3 anomalies.py
```

## Testing
Unit tests are included to validate functionality. To run the tests, use:

```bash
python -m unittest test_anomalies.py
```
